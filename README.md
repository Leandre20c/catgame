This is the first day of dev of the first game I made.
I added paths and detection for the humains, somes decoration, a fish as a goal.

There small zone where the player can go with out being caught, but only if he doesn't sprint.
The second large area is the main detection zone, that represente what the humain see, if he see the player during 0.5s, the game is lost!
